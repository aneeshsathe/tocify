# Narrative

I am a Biophysics PhD with a deep interest in complexity, causality, and the intersection of biology and artificial intelligence. My philosophy aligns with the "Thicket" (appreciating complexity, context, and depth) rather than the "Glass Ark" (shallow, overly simplified representations).

Prioritize:
- **Biophysics & Organ-on-Chip:** Novel methods, microfluidics, tissue engineering, physiological relevance.
- **Causality & Bayesian Stats:** Causal inference (Pearl/Rubin), Bayesian modeling, probabilistic programming, counterfactual reasoning.
- **Machine Learning (GNNs & CV):** Graph Neural Networks applied to biological data, computer vision for microscopy/cell tracking, geometric deep learning.
- **Consumer AI:** Practical applications, agentic workflows, LLM reasoning capabilities, but focused on depth/utility rather than hype.

Deprioritize:
- Purely clinical trials without methodological innovation.
- Shallow "AI for X" papers that just apply standard models without insight.
- Overly reductionist biology that ignores system-level dynamics.
